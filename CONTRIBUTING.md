# Contributing Guide

This guide defines contribution standards for the project's human authors, co-authors, and AI agents acting as contributing entities.

Formatting is enforced by `.clang-format`. Contributors should run the formatter instead of manually debating whitespace, wrapping, brace placement, pointer alignment, or similar layout rules.

---

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Build the project with `.\build.bat`.
4. Before submitting changes, format modified C++ files.

---

## Language & Build

|            Item | Standard                         |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|
|        Language | C++23 (`CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 23`)  |
|        Compiler | MSVC 2022 (primary)              |
|    Build system | CMake 3.21+ (presets schema v3)  |
| Package manager | vcpkg                            |
|         Testing | Google Test with CTest discovery |

---

## Core Principle

Prefer code that is:

- easy to read
- easy to review
- easy to debug
- easy to extend safely

Consistency matters more than personal preference.

---

## What `clang-format` Already Covers

The repository formatter already defines the mechanical style for C++ source, including:

- indentation and tabs/spaces
- brace layout
- constructor initializer formatting
- pointer/reference alignment
- spacing around control statements
- include sorting behavior
- wrapping/alignment of arguments, parameters, and comments

Do not restate or fight these rules in review. Run the formatter and move on.

## Naming Conventions

| Element                          | Style                                       | Examples                                                  |

| Type aliases                     | PascalCase via `using`                      | `using EntityId = std::uint32_t;`                         |
| Global mutable state             | avoided (no `g_` prefix)                    | prefer file-local `constexpr`; see **Scoping & Lifetime** |

### Struct fields (plain data)

Plain structs used as passive data holders (value types, POD aggregates) use **unprefixed `camelCase`** fields (no `m_`, no methods, no invariants):

```cpp
struct Particle
{
    Vec2 position{};       ///< Current world position.
    Vec2 velocity{};       ///< Units moved per second.
    float lifetime{1.0f};  ///< Seconds of life remaining.
};
```

The `m_` prefix is reserved for the private members of behavior-bearing **classes**; plain-data structs never use it.

### Prefer named data over positional data

Prefer small structs with named fields over `std::pair`, `std::tuple`, or multi-value conventions that rely on positional meaning.

Use tuples only when the meaning is already obvious and local.

---

## Source File Organization

### Header files

Every header starts with `#pragma once`. Do not use include guards.

```cpp
#pragma once
```

### Include order

Group includes in this order, separated by a blank line between groups:

1. Corresponding header (`.cpp` files only)
2. Project headers
3. External / third-party headers
4. Standard library headers

Keep includes minimal, explicit, and local to actual usage.

### Forward declarations

Prefer including the real dependency over relying on forward declarations.

Use forward declarations only when they provide a clear benefit, such as breaking a circular dependency or reducing heavy include cost in a stable interface.

Do not use forward declarations that make ownership, inheritance, or required type completeness unclear.

### Inline definitions

Only define functions inline when they are genuinely small and benefit from being in the header.

Long or non-trivial implementations belong in `.cpp` files.

---

## Scoping & Lifetime

### Namespaces

* Never use `using namespace` in header files.
* In `.cpp` files, limit `using` directives to narrow scopes.
* Prefer `using std::string;` over `using namespace std;` when local aliasing is helpful.

### Local variables

* Declare variables in the narrowest practical scope.
* Initialize variables when declared.
* Do not separate declaration from first meaningful value unless there is a clear reason.
* Prefer loop-local variables inside the loop statement.

### Internal linkage

Functions, constants, and helpers used only within one translation unit should have internal linkage.

Prefer an unnamed namespace in `.cpp` files for file-local helpers.

```cpp
namespace
{
    float ComputeWeight(float x)
    {
        return x * x;
    }
}
```

### Static and global storage

Avoid non-trivial global state.

Rules:

* prefer `constexpr` or `constinit` where applicable
* prefer function-local statics over namespace-scope mutable singletons
* objects with static storage duration should be trivially destructible unless there is a strong reason otherwise
* global strings should usually be string literals or `std::string_view`, not dynamically initialized `std::string`

---

## Control Flow

### Always use braces

Use braces for all control-flow bodies, even single statements.

This is a project rule even if formatting could make a one-liner look acceptable.

### Prefer early exits

Reduce nesting when possible:

* return early on invalid state
* continue early in loops
* keep the main path visually obvious

### Switch statements

* Prefer `enum class` over unscoped enums.
* Handle all enumerators explicitly when practical.
* Use `default` only when it is actually desired behavior, not as a way to suppress missing-case thinking.

---

## Classes & Types

### Struct vs. class

Use `struct` for passive data containers with public fields and no invariants.

Use `class` for types with invariants, encapsulation, ownership, or behavior.

### Constructors

* Avoid doing heavy work in constructors when failure is possible.
* Avoid virtual dispatch in constructors and destructors.
* If initialization can fail meaningfully, prefer a factory or an `Initialize()` step.

### Explicit conversions

Mark single-argument constructors and conversion operators `explicit` unless implicit conversion is clearly intended and beneficial.

Copy and move constructors are exempt.

```cpp
explicit Texture(const std::string& path);
```

### Copy/move behavior

Be explicit about ownership semantics.

A type should clearly communicate whether it is:

* copyable
* move-only
* neither copyable nor movable

Delete or default the relevant operations intentionally. Do not leave semantics ambiguous.

```cpp
Texture(Texture&& other) noexcept;
Texture& operator=(Texture&& other) noexcept;
Texture(const Texture&) = delete;
Texture& operator=(const Texture&) = delete;
```

### Operator overloading

Only overload operators when behavior is obvious, conventional, and unsurprising.

Do not overload operators with unusual semantics. Never overload:

* `&&`
* `||`
* `,`
* unary `&`

---

## Functions

### Prefer clear interfaces

* Prefer return values over output parameters.
* Keep parameter lists short and meaningful.
* Put inputs before outputs.
* Prefer strong, descriptive types over ambiguous booleans or loosely related parameter packs.

### Parameter guidance

* cheap input values: pass by value
* non-cheap input values: pass by `const T&`
* output or in/out values: pass by `T&`
* optional input: `const T*` or `std::optional<T>`
* optional output: `T*`

Use raw pointers to express optionality or non-ownership, not ownership transfer.

### Boolean parameters

Avoid multiple boolean parameters in one function signature.

This is hard to read:

```cpp
CreateWidget(true, false, true);
```

Prefer an options struct, enum flags, or separate functions when intent is not obvious.

### Function size

Keep functions focused.

A function that needs multiple screens, many nested branches, or several unrelated responsibilities should usually be split.

---

## Ownership & Resource Management

### Ownership must be obvious

Use types to communicate ownership.

* `std::unique_ptr` for exclusive ownership
* `std::shared_ptr` only when shared lifetime is genuinely required
* raw pointers and references for non-owning access
* references when null is not valid
* pointers when null is a meaningful state

### `std::shared_ptr` is not a default

Use `std::shared_ptr` only with clear justification. Shared ownership makes lifetime harder to reason about and can hide architecture problems.

Be especially careful about cycles.

### RAII first

Prefer RAII-based resource management over manual acquire/release patterns.

If a type owns a resource, make cleanup automatic and local to the type.

---

## Error Handling

### Choose one clear strategy per API

Use the most suitable mechanism for the layer:

* assertions for programmer errors and impossible states
* return values / `std::optional` / expected-style patterns for normal recoverable failure
* exceptions only where the project or subsystem explicitly uses them

Do not mix multiple error-handling strategies in the same small API without a good reason.

### Assertions

Use assertions to document invariants and programmer assumptions, not user-driven runtime conditions.

An assertion should mean: if this fails, the code is wrong.

---

## Comments & Documentation

Documentation comments are written for a **Doxygen-style documentation generator** (e.g. Doxygen or Doxide) that parses `@`-command Javadoc comments. The house style is deliberately **split between headers and sources**; follow it consistently, because a de-sync is easy to introduce. `clang-format` runs with `ReflowComments: Always`, so it *does* rewrap comment prose to the 100-column limit. Do not hand-wrap prose to fight it. It applies the same rewrap inside `@verbatim` blocks and fenced code blocks: a diagram line longer than 100 columns is wrapped *and* its runs of spaces are collapsed, which destroys the art silently. Keep every comment line, diagrams included, at or under 100 columns counting the leading `` * ``.

### The header/source split (the core rule)

|                       | `.hpp`                                                  | `.cpp`                                            |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Doc-comment styles    | `/** ... */` blocks, `///` one-liners, `///<` trailing  | plain `//` only                                   |
| Doxygen commands      | yes (`@brief`, `@param`, `@ingroup`, ...)               | **no** - with a single exception: `@author`       |
| `@author`             | file/type-level, `[NAME] (https://github.com/[USER])`   | optional `// @author <Name> (<url>)` line         |

### General comment rule

Comment the reason, constraint, or non-obvious behavior. Do not comment what the code already says plainly. Preserve ASCII diagrams and worked-example traces in algorithm-heavy code - they are house style, not clutter.

Bad:

```cpp
count++; // Increment count
```

Better:

```cpp
count++; // Includes the sentinel slot reserved during parsing.
```

### Where documentation lives

* Header files: documentation for the public-facing API (types, functions, members).
* Source files: implementation notes for non-obvious logic.

---

### Header (`.hpp`) documentation

#### Block vs. one-line form

* A doc comment that spans **more than one line** is a Javadoc **block**: `/**` on its own line, a leading ` * ` on every continuation line, a bare ` *` for blank separator lines, and ` */` to close.
* A doc comment that fits on **one physical line** uses `///` (e.g. a lone `/// @brief ...` above a simple declaration, or a group marker).
* Use only these two styles in headers. Do **not** use the `//!` or `/*! */` "bang" variants.

```cpp
/// @brief Reset the buffer to its empty state.
void Clear();

/**
 * @brief Resize the buffer, preserving existing contents.
 * @param newSize   Desired capacity, in elements.
 * @param zeroFill  Whether newly added slots are zero-initialized.
 */
void Resize(std::size_t newSize, bool zeroFill);
```

#### File / type header block

The block documenting a header's primary type (or namespace) uses a **fixed tag order**:

1. **Kind tag** - `@struct Name`, `@class Name`, `@enum Name`, or `@namespace Name`. Name the primary entity the header defines. Every namespace header in `src/` uses `@namespace`; follow that form.
2. `@brief` - a one-line summary ending in a period.
3. `@author [NAME] (https://github.com/[USER])` - the same attribution string everywhere. **File / type-level only**; never repeated on a function, method, or member.
4. `@ingroup <Module>` - one of the modules your project defines (see below).
5. a blank ` *`, then prose.

```cpp
/**
 * @struct Color
 * @brief 8-bit RGBA color.
 * @author [NAME] (https://github.com/[USER])
 * @ingroup <Module>
 *
 * Plain data struct: a flat aggregate with no invariants, usable directly as
 * a value type. Blending helpers live in the free functions in ColorMath.hpp.
 *
 * @see ColorMath
 */
```

A namespace / free-function header leads with `@namespace`:

```cpp
/**
 * @namespace VecMath
 * @brief Pure, dependency-free 2D vector math helpers.
 * @author [NAME] (https://github.com/[USER])
 * @ingroup <Module>
 *
 * Each function is a stateless free function operating on plain values, with
 * no global or GPU state.
 */
```

Do **not** use `@file` - leave file identity implicit.

#### Modules (`@ingroup`)

Most documented entities are grouped under a module with `@ingroup <Module>`, but this is not universal and must not be applied mechanically - see the path warning below. Modules are declared **once** in `doxide.yml`, under the top-level `groups:` key; source files only *reference* them with `@ingroup`. There is no group-definitions header in this repository, and `@addtogroup` is not used anywhere in `src/`. To add a module, add it to the `groups:` tree in `doxide.yml` first, then reference it.

Choose the module by **subsystem role, not filename**: a rendering helper belongs to the rendering module even when its filename names the feature it serves rather than the module.

#### Function / method documentation

A `/** */` block: `@brief` first, a blank line, prose, then `@param` (name + description, continuation lines aligned under the description) and `@return`. **No `@author`.** The spelling is `@return`, never `@returns`.

Keep the brief line **plain text**. Do not put `@p`, `@ref` or square brackets in it - see "Command vocabulary" below. Put a parameter reference or a range such as `[0, 1)` in the prose, `@param` or `@return` text instead, where both are safe.

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Linearly interpolate between @p a and @p b by @p t.
 *
 * @p t is clamped to [0, 1], so values outside that range saturate to the
 * nearest endpoint.
 *
 * @param a  Start value, returned when @p t is 0.
 * @param b  End value, returned when @p t is 1.
 * @param t  Blend factor in [0, 1].
 * @return   The interpolated value.
 */
float Lerp(float a, float b, float t);
```

#### Members and enum values

Document a struct field or enumerator **inline with a trailing `///<`** when the text fits on the member's line. `///<` is the **only** trailing style this guide uses - not `/**< */`, `//!<`, or `/*!< */`.

```cpp
struct Color
{
    std::uint8_t r{0};    ///< Red channel.
    std::uint8_t g{0};    ///< Green channel.
    std::uint8_t b{0};    ///< Blue channel.
    std::uint8_t a{255};  ///< Alpha channel (255 = opaque).
};

enum class LogLevel
{
    Debug,    ///< Verbose developer diagnostics.
    Info,     ///< Normal operational messages.
    Warning,  ///< Recoverable problems worth attention.
    Error     ///< Failures that abort the current operation.
};
```

When a field description is too long for a trailing `///<`, use **leading `///` lines** above the member instead. This is the one place a `///` comment may span multiple lines; never put a `/** */` block on an individual field or enumerator.

```cpp
/// Master enable flag. When false the renderer skips the entire post-processing
/// chain (blur, bloom, tone-mapping) and presents the raw scene texture
/// unmodified. Toggled at runtime from the developer console.
bool postProcessEnabled{true};
```

#### Grouping related members

Separate related members with a plain `//` section comment. Do **not** use `@name` / `@{` / `@}` member groups: doxide 0.9.0 copies those commands literally into the generated Markdown and attaches the group text to the summary row of the next member, and large headers that use them have crashed `doxide build`, which aborts `build.bat`. The `//` idiom in `Settings.hpp` and `RenderSettingsSnapshot` is the house form.

```cpp
// Window state
Window* m_Window = nullptr;  ///< Owned OS window handle.
int m_Width = 1280;          ///< Client-area width, in pixels.
int m_Height = 720;          ///< Client-area height, in pixels.
bool m_Initialized = false;  ///< Whether creation succeeded (for safe teardown).
```

#### Command vocabulary

Documentation commands to use where useful:

`@brief`, `@author`, `@ingroup`, `@struct` / `@class` / `@enum` / `@namespace`, `@param`, `@return`, `@tparam`, `@pre` / `@post`, `@note` / `@warning`, `@p` / `@c` / `@see`, `@code` / `@endcode` (and `@code{.cpp}`), and `@verbatim` / `@endverbatim` for ASCII diagrams.

For math, write a `$$ ... $$` block: the mkdocs pipeline renders it through arithmatex. For diagrams, use a fenced `mermaid` code block, or `@verbatim` for ASCII art.

**The brief line is a special case.** `@p` and square brackets are safe in prose, `@param` and `@return` text, but not in the brief - that is the `@brief` line, or the first prose line when the block omits `@brief`. doxide 0.9.0 has mis-parsed such a brief on large real headers: it stops emitting the type pages for that file and exits non-zero, so `build.bat` fails at the documentation step. A minimal single-header repro does **not** reproduce it, so treat this as a rule, not as something you can confirm quickly in isolation. Note also that the `unrecognized command: brief` line is **not** the symptom: doxide 0.9.0 emits that line, and `unrecognized command: author`, once per run for any use of `@brief` or `@author` at all. `scripts/_clean_docs.py` strips both tags before mkdocs runs, so the log line is expected noise on every clean build.

Do **not** use: `@file`, `@returns`, `@union`, `@short`, `@defgroup`, `@addtogroup`, `@def`, `@fn`, `@var`, `@internal`, `@par`, `@ref`, `@name` / `@{` / `@}`, and the LaTeX forms `@f[ ... @f]` / `@f$ ... @f$`. doxide 0.9.0 does not understand `@par`, `@ref`, `@name` / `@{` / `@}`, or the LaTeX forms: it copies them into the published Markdown as literal text, and `@ref` links the wrong word.

**`@p` and `@c` take the whole next whitespace-delimited token, punctuation included.** `@p roll.` publishes as `` `roll.` `` - the period ends up inside the code span, and `@p size)` swallows the closing parenthesis. Backtick-quote the identifier yourself whenever the reference is followed immediately by `.`, `,`, `;`, `:` or `)`: write ``the caller owns `roll`.`` rather than `@p roll.`. Use `@p` only when a space follows the name.

**`@ingroup` decides the generated page path, so never add, remove or change one without rebuilding the docs and updating `mkdocs.yml`.** The `nav:` tree is hand-maintained against the paths doxide emits, and a mismatch is reported only as an mkdocs *warning* - `mkdocs build` and `build.bat` still exit 0, so the broken nav entry ships silently. Verified against doxide 0.9.0:

| Entity | Without `@ingroup` | With `@ingroup Mod` |
|---|---|---|
| top-level namespace `Foo` | `docs/Foo/` | `docs/Foo/` (unchanged) |
| nested namespace `Foo::Bar` | `docs/Foo/Bar/` | `docs/Bar/` |
| type `T` inside namespace `Foo` | `docs/Foo/T.md` | `docs/Mod/.../T.md` |

Two consequences. **Never put `@ingroup` on a nested namespace block** - it detaches the page from its parent and orphans every nav entry beneath it. And a type that the nav reaches through its namespace path must stay ungrouped; the `Settings` structs are the example. doxide logs `namespace cannot have @ingroup, ignoring` for every namespace block, which makes the tag look inert - it is not.

---

### Source (`.cpp`) documentation

* **`//` line comments only.** No `/** */` blocks, no `///` (not even trailing `///<`), and no Doxygen commands (`@brief`, `@param`, `@return`, `@ingroup`, `@par`, `@note`, ...).
* The **one exception** is an authorship line, written as a plain `// @author <Name> (<url>)` (e.g. `// @author [NAME] (https://github.com/[USER])`). Keep existing attributions as-is; don't rewrite them.
* When moving header prose into a `.cpp`, **strip the Doxygen markup**: `@p name` -> `name` (or backtick-quote it: `` `name` ``), `@c Buffer{}` -> plain `Buffer{}`, `@ref Foo` -> `Foo`. Backtick-quoting an identifier is the house substitute for `@c` / `@p` inside `//` comments.
* A file-header contract block is optional: complex files (algorithms, pipelines) carry a top-of-file `//` summary - often with an ASCII diagram or worked example - while simpler files go straight from includes to code. Either way, add a one-line `//` intent comment above a function whenever its purpose isn't self-evident.

```cpp
// RingBuffer - fixed-capacity FIFO used by the audio mixer.
//
// @author [NAME] (https://github.com/[USER])
// Reads and writes advance independent cursors modulo the capacity. The
// buffer is treated as full when the write cursor sits one slot behind the
// read cursor, so exactly one slot is always reserved to tell full from empty.
```

```cpp
// Clamp the requested gain to [0, 1] before applying the fade curve.
void SetGain(Channel& channel, float gain)
```

### TODO comments

Use `TODO` only for real follow-up work, not vague reminders.

Make them specific and actionable:

```cpp
// TODO: Replace with a spatial hash once the element count exceeds 10k.
```

---

## API Design Preferences

### Prefer expressive types

Use enums, structs, aliases, and dedicated small types when they make interfaces clearer.

Prefer:

```cpp
struct LoadOptions
{
    bool allowCache;
    bool validateSchema;
};
```

over:

```cpp
bool Load(bool allowCache, bool validateSchema);
```

### Prefer compile-time guarantees

When a rule can be enforced by the type system, `constexpr`, `constinit`, or RAII, prefer that over comments and conventions.

### Avoid hidden work

Functions should not unexpectedly:

* allocate heavily
* block for long periods
* mutate unrelated global state
* transfer ownership invisibly

Make expensive or stateful behavior visible in the API.

---

## Testing

All non-trivial behavior changes should include tests or a clear reason why tests are not practical.

Add or update tests when you change:

* parsing logic
* math/transform code
* serialization
* state machines
* public APIs
* bug fixes with reproducible behavior

A bug fix without a regression test should be the exception, not the norm.

---

## Pull Requests

### Scope

Keep pull requests focused.

Do not mix unrelated refactors, formatting-only churn, feature work, and bug fixes in the same PR unless there is a strong reason.

### What to include

A good PR should explain:

* what changed
* why it changed
* any important tradeoffs
* how it was validated

### Reviewer expectations

Reviewers should prioritize:

* correctness
* maintainability
* API clarity
* architecture fit
* test coverage

Do not spend review time re-litigating rules that are already enforced automatically by tooling.

## AI-Assisted Contributions

AI assistance is allowed, but the contributor remains fully responsible for the submitted code.

If you use AI, you must still ensure that the result is:

* correct
* project-consistent
* buildable
* testable
* understandable by a human reviewer

Do not submit generated code you do not understand.

Pay extra attention to:

* hallucinated APIs
* incorrect ownership assumptions
* fake includes
* wrong engine/library types
* missing edge cases
* overly generic comments or documentation
